Aaradyha (Pronounced Aradia - meaning Wisdom in Hindu) is a three column Moodle theme built specifically with RTL (right to left) languages in mind. The pagelayout is based on Matthew James Taylors Perfect Holy Grail (percentage) Layout, and works pretty well in Internet Explorer 7, for those who are forced to use the older browser. This is not to say there wont be any display issues with IE7, as there undoubtedly will be.  Although this theme is designed for Moodle 2.3 it is possible it will work in other versions of Moodle such as Moodle 2.1.x and Moodle 2.2.x.

Aaradyha is built on Base theme so that any future CSS updates in Base with be picked up automatically by this theme, with the exception of pagelayout.css. This is because of the specific layout of this theme, that it was necessary to EXCLUDE base theme's pagelayout.css.  That said, it is not envisaged that the layout for this theme will alter, but if it does then you will need to update to a newer version of Aaradyha from the Moodle Plugins Directory at http://Moodle.org/plugins/.

You will be pleased to learn that Aaradyha has a Custom settings page where you can change the look of the header and footer and also add custom CSS. This means you can add background images to your header and footer using CSS, and also add a logo directly into the header, and/or the footer, at the same time as well as add some text.

If you want to use a specific font-family, or change font-size and color, you can do all that too by adding the CSS rules for these changes. Of course you will need to know a fair bit about CSS, but if you don't then help is always at hand in the Moodle themes forum. http://Moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46

Last but now the least, you can add a custom menu in the Custom settings page of Aaradyha. This means that were you to duplicate this theme to use as a course theme, you could in effect have different menus in different situations.  All very new and exciting! Soo all the places where you can allow theme changes by course, category, or user you have the potential to change the menu for all these themes. This is advanced themeing for those wanting the challenge.
